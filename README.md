## Xeno Marketer Dashboard – Homepage Redesign
Product Manager Assignment – README

>This project presents a redesigned Homepage Dashboard for Xeno — the first screen a retail marketer sees after logging into the platform.
The homepage is designed with two primary goals:
    1    Immediate clarity – Understand “what’s happening right now” across campaigns, customers, segments, and journeys.
    2    Faster action – Enable marketers to perform their most common actions with minimal clicks.

### Objectives
The redesigned homepage aims to:
    •    Provide a real-time view of campaign and account performance
    •    Surface alerts and issues that require immediate attention
    •    Highlight AI-driven recommendations to guide marketers
    •    Offer high-impact quick actions to reduce workflow friction
    •    Showcase segments and automated journeys to drive user adoption
    •    Create a dashboard that is both insightful and actionable
